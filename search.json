FLAMES performs cell barcode UMI assignment nanopore reads well semi-supervised isoform detection quantification. FLAMES designed easy quick use, powerful workflow isoform detection quantification, splicing analysis mutation detection, seeks overcome limitations tools, inability process single cell data, focus cell barcode UMI assignment (Tian et al. 2020). R package represents enhanced iteration FLAMES Python module originally designed support research work presented Comprehensive characterization single-cell full-length isoforms human mouse long-read sequencing Tian et al (2020). upgraded R version simplifies installation execution processes also incorporates additional functionality, streamlining analysis single-cell full-length isoforms using long-read sequencing data. processing single cell data, FLAMES can run data generated long-read platform without matched short-read sequencing data. long reads available, FLAMES takes input long reads fastq files. blaze() function called demultiplex long reads cell-specific fastq files. short-read data unavailable, FLAMES incorporates BLAZE blaze() function identify cell barcodes solely long reads (et al. 2023). blaze() function called locate barcode sequencing long-reads, identify barcode allow-list directly long reads, assign reads cells (.e., demultiplexing) trims cell barcodes flanking UMI sequence. matched short-read single-cell RNA sequencing data available, FLAMES take cell barcode allow-list generated short reads addition long-read fastq files. short-read allow-list used reference guide demultiplexing long reads. , FLAMES incorporates flexiplex find_barcode() function perform demultiplexing (Davidson et al. 2023). find_barcode() function called extract cell barcode UMI sequence long reads, using allow-list reference. demultiplexing, pipeline calls minimap_align(), minimap2 wrapper, align demultiplex long-reads reference genome. quantify_gene() called deduplicate reads unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) generate gene-level UMI counts. Note UMI deduplication, pipeline keeps longest reads among UMI downstream steps. Next, find_isoform() called identify novel isoforms using alignment, creating updated transcript assembly. step, users may choose use bambu, designed transcript discovery quantification using long read RNA-Seq data (Chen et al. 2023). Otherwise, users use build-isoform identification methods FLAMES. methods wrapped find_isoform() function. Afterwards, demultiplexed reads aligned transcript assembly function minimap_realign(). Finally, FLAMES calls quantify_transcript() quantify transcript counts using (re-)alignment file.
